// The fence (defaults.container.fencing allowed-mems): the NUMA nodes F on
// which the driver onlines CXL memory, numa slices of local memdevs and
// pool devices in mode numa. A fenced container has a fenced node in its
// cpuset.mems only when one of its allocation results has numa memory on it
// or it borrows it (wantMems). F is seeded at the start from the grants of
// this boot (Seed) and only grows; a node is fenced before its memory goes
// online: Fence returns after the containers have been updated through NRI,
// or at the end of its context, the pass finishing in the background. With
// fencing none F stays empty.
//
// A fence pass applies wantMems to the fenced containers of the table under
// the update token, like a lend, so that lends and passes never compute from
// stale sets. A pass runs when a node is fenced, when fencing of running
// containers becomes ready (NRI synchronized and the lends restored), for
// one container at its PostStartContainer and periodically (the repair
// passes), in the background but for Fence. A failed update is
// tried again by the next pass.
