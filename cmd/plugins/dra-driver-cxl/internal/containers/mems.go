// The cpuset.mems of the containers that the plugin does not steer: one
// computation (wantMems) and one writer (applyMems), under the update token.
//
// A fenced container (FENCED) has cpuset.mems = wantMems: its own nodes
// without the fenced nodes, the CXL numa nodes of its allocation results
// and the nodes lent to it. CreateContainer gives a new container wantMems
// as an adjustment when that differs from its spec; a fence pass and a
// lend update it when wantMems differs from its cgroup (from its spec
// before its task exists).
//
// A container that is neither fenced nor steered (NONE, fencing none)
// keeps the cpuset.mems that the runtime gave it. If that is empty (the
// usual case) the container has the memory nodes of its parent, every node
// with memory, also those whose memory goes online later, and a lend or a
// revoke only records the holders of the node: an update with an empty
// cpuset.mems changes nothing, so the container would not inherit any
// more, and a revoke would take a node that still has memory off it. A
// container with a cpuset.mems of its own (set by the runtime, such as by
// kubelet's memory manager, or fenced by a plugin with fencing allowed-mems
// before a switch to none: it keeps that until it is created again) gets
// its base + the lent nodes, never below the claimed nodes that it had
// before any lend; an update that its cgroup and its spec both have
// already is not sent (a later update of its resources writes the spec's
// cpuset.mems to the cgroup).
//
// Updates before the start: containerd applies an NRI update to the cgroup
// only of a container that it has marked started, which it does after task
// start, right before PostStartContainer. Of a container that it has
// created but not marked started it changes only the spec, which reaches
// the cgroup only if the task is created after it, and the task is created
// before the StartContainer event; one that is not in its store yet
// (during CreateContainer) it skips. Both are reported as applied. So the
// OnContainerStarted callbacks and the repair pass of the started container
// run from PostStartContainer, and lends and passes compare with the
// cpuset.mems of the cgroup of a container whose task exists (curMems), and
// update it again when it differs. Not covered: a revoke of a container
// that is not fenced between its StartContainer and its PostStartContainer
// reaches its spec only, and its cgroup keeps the node (with fencing none
// the plugin keeps no container off a node, and offlining migrates the
// pages of the node whatever cpuset.mems says).

// wantMems returns the cpuset.mems that the plugin gives a container, its
// base, and false when the plugin gives it none. Fenced: its own nodes
// without the fenced nodes and the changed node (the base), with the nodes
// of its claims and the lent nodes; its own nodes are the cpuset.mems of its
// spec, the nodes with memory (mem) when the spec has none, an error when
// they are unknown. Fencing none with a cpuset.mems of its own: its own
// nodes without the changed node but with the claimed nodes that it had
// before any lend (the base), with the lent nodes. Fencing none with an
// empty cpuset.mems (it inherits the nodes of its parent: an update would
// pin it) and steered: none.
