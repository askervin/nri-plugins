// Package dra is the DRA front-end of the driver: one Plugin type with two
// instances, cxl.nri.io (the local memdevs, regions, DRAM and the lease
// device of the node; it publishes the node's ResourceSlice) and the pool
// driver, that differ only in their SourceRules. A claim is one Preparation
// record per driver (internal/state) with a result per allocation result:
// a grant on a memdev that the device engine realises, a region, the DRAM,
// or the lease claim. The package has the companion gate of lease claims,
// the CDI spec of each driver built from the records, and the publisher of
// the node's ResourceSlice. The transition table of Preparation.State is in
// docs/memory/cxl/states.md.
