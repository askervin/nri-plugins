// Package leases is the lease broker of the CXL memory driver: the lease
// claims of the pods (claims on the lease device of cxl.nri.io), their
// sockets and the protocol of the cxl-request CLI on them, the leases that
// running containers ask for there, the companion claims and pods that
// hold the memory of the leases, and the reconcile that releases what is
// left over.
//
// Objects: Lease (lease.go) and LeaseClaim (leaseclaim.go), whose records
// and transition tables are state.Lease and state.LeaseClaim; the Broker
// (broker.go) that owns them; the companion (companion.go) with the hooks
// that the drivers call while they prepare it; the identity of the peers
// of the sockets (identity.go). The states and their transitions are
// rendered in docs/memory/cxl/states.md.
