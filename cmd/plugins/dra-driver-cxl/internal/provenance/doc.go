// Package provenance knows which memdevs of the node are devices of a
// memory pool: the Provenance record of each serial (UNKNOWN, HELD, POOL,
// LOCAL) and the Watcher that lists the pool driver's ResourceSlices and
// the pool claims of the node. Its consumers are the publisher of the
// node's ResourceSlice, which never publishes a pool device or a held
// memdev as a local one, and the device engine's check before a local
// grant (CheckLocal, with a fresh list). The transition table of
// Provenance.State is in internal/state and docs/memory/cxl/states.md.
