// Package state has the records that the CXL DRA driver remembers, one
// file per record type: Preparation, Grant (with its Bind), Memdev, Region
// (with its DaxDevices and Mounts), Provenance, Lease, LeaseClaim and
// Steered. Every State field is an enum with its transition table as data
// next to the type; Apply refuses a transition that is not in the table.
// The tables and the record headers are rendered into
// docs/memory/cxl/states.md by go generate (internal/statedoc).
