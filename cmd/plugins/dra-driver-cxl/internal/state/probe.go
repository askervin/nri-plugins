// Probe is the result of the address line probe of a local memdev whose
// memory aliases: offsets X and X+P reach the same memory, so only the
// first UsableSize bytes are distinct. The regions of the memdev are made
// with that size from then on, and the publisher publishes it.
//
// Identity: the serial of the memdev, the key of the file in hex without
// 0x.
//
// States: none: a fact about the hardware, recorded when a probe finds
// aliasing.
//
// Transitions: none; the driver never removes a probe, an operator removes
// the file to probe every memdev again.
//
// Invariants: UsableSize is a positive multiple of 256 MiB.
//
// Persistence: <plugin data dir>/localProbes.json, not the document: it
// survives a reboot, the e2e state cleanup and --discard-old-state, so
// that no start probes a memdev again.
//
// Locks and waits: written by the engine in the queue of the memdev.
