// Provenance is the sticky knowledge of the source of a serial: whether a
// memdev with it is a device of a memory pool or a device of the node. The
// current API view does not tell: a pool device may be attached while the
// pool's ResourceSlices are gone, or before its claim has status data.
//
// Identity: Serial.
//
// States: ProvenanceState. UNKNOWN: no record. HELD: a new memdev not
// published because its source is uncertain (HeldReason). LOCAL: established
// as a device of the node. POOL: seen in a pool ResourceSlice, in a pool
// claim's status data or prepared by the pool driver; sticky.
//
// Transitions: ProvenanceTable below; a transition not in it is refused.
//
// Invariants: POOL never turns LOCAL; no new local grant on a serial that is
// POOL or HELD.
//
// Persistence: fact, the only copy of the provenance; the records of POOL
// and LOCAL serials with Pool and LastSeen (committed at most hourly when
// only LastSeen changed), and of HELD serials with HeldSince and HeldReason
// (committed durably when the hold starts, ends or changes its reason), kept
// across restarts and reboots: a hold goes on from its HeldSince.
// LastObserved and the absence of a serial are kept in memory only: a
// restart observes them anew.
//
// Locks and waits: the provenance watcher is the only writer.
