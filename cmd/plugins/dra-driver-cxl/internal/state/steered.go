// Steered is the record of a container whose cgroup a steering manager of
// the driver writes. So the records of a process that was killed, or that
// exited on the loss of NRI, name the containers whose memory.high its
// managers left, and the next process releases exactly those, whatever
// their settings say now.
//
// Identity: Container, the container ID.
//
// States: none; the record exists from before the manager writes the
// cgroup until the manager has stopped.
//
// Transitions: none.
//
// Invariants: a container has at most one record.
//
// Persistence: intent; committed durably before the manager starts, on a
// small bounded commit path, and removed after it stopped.
//
// Locks and waits: the container plugin's table mutex.
