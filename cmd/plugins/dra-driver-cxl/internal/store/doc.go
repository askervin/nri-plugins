// Package store keeps the one persistent document of the CXL DRA driver,
// state.json in the plugin data directory of cxl.nri.io: the records of
// package state (Preparation, Grant, Memdev, Region, Provenance,
// ListedPool, Lease, LeaseClaim, Steered), their states documented in
// docs/memory/cxl/states.md.
//
// A commit is a pure function of the document applied to a copy; one
// writer goroutine applies the pending commits in groups and writes each
// group once (a synced temporary file, the current file linked to
// state.json.prev, a rename, a synced directory) before readers see it.
// Durable commits wait for that write, lazy ones only for their
// application. A failed write discards the group: the snapshot is never
// ahead of the disk. A failed sync of the directory is the one case where
// the disk may be ahead: the discarded group may be visible in state.json,
// and the next write links it to state.json.prev with its generation; this
// is harmless because a record is committed before the kernel objects it
// names are made.
//
// The document is decoded strictly: an unknown field, another schema, data
// after the document or a state that a stored record may not have make it
// undecodable, so a record field added by a later build makes an older
// build start LOST: drain the node's claims before a rollback. When neither
// state.json nor state.json.prev decodes the store is LOST and refuses
// every commit. At a load of another boot the records are changed as a
// reboot requires. After every commit the store writes the views of the
// five files that test90's observer reads, in their established format,
// marked with "viewOf": "state.json", without syncing them.
