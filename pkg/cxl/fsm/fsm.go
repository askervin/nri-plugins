// Package fsm has the transition tables of state fields as data: the rows
// {from, to, trigger, guard, effects} of one state field, and the rules
// that apply them.
//
// A table is either applied or observed. The states of an applied table
// (the records of a driver) change only through Apply, which refuses a
// transition that no row has, a step that keeps the state included. The
// states of an observed table (the kernel's objects) are read, never
// applied: Check tells whether an observed change is a row of the table,
// and an unchanged state is always allowed.
