"""topology2qemuopts - convert system structures from JSON to Qemu options

System structures are given in a JSON list of
- NUMA node group definitions and
- CXL structures (optional).

topology2qemuopts outputs Qemu command line parameters that emulate a
system with given structures. Use environment variable
SEPARATED_OUTPUT_VARS=1 to group parameters in separate categories.

NUMA node group definitions:
"mem"                 mem (RAM) size on each NUMA node in this group.
                      The default is "0G".
"nvmem"               nvmem (non-volatile RAM) size on each NUMA node
                      in this group. The default is "0G".
"dimm"                "": the default, memory is there without pc-dimm defined.
                      "plugged": start with cold plugged pc-dimm.
                      "unplugged": start with free slot for hot plug.
                        Add the dimm in Qemu monitor at runtime:
                          device_add pc-dimm,id=dimmX,memdev=memX,node=X
                        or
                          device_add nvdimm,id=nvdimmX,memdev=nvmemX,node=X
"cores"               number of CPU cores on each NUMA node in this group.
                      The default is 0.
"threads"             number of threads on each CPU core.
                      The default is 2.
"nodes"               number of NUMA nodes on each die.
                      The default is 1.
"dies"                number of dies on each package.
                      The default is 1.
"packages"            number of packages.
                      The default is 1.
"cpus-present"        number of logical CPUs present in the system.
                      The default value 0 means "all".

NUMA node distances are defined with following keys:
"dist-all": [[from0to0, from0to1, ...], [from1to0, from1to1, ...], ...]
                      distances from every node to all nodes.
                      The order is the same as in to numactl -H
                      "node distances:" output.
"node-dist": {"node": dist, ...}
                      symmetrical distances from nodes in this group to other
                      nodes.

Distances that apply to all NUMA groups if defined in any:
"dist-same-die": N    the default distance between NUMA nodes on the same die.
"dist-same-package": N the default distance between NUMA nodes on the same package.
"dist-other-package": N  the default distance between NUMA nodes in other packages.

Note that the distance from a node to itself is always 10. The default
distance to a node on the same die is 11, and to other nodes on the
same and different packages is 21.

Example: Each of the first two NUMA groups in the list contains two
NUMA nodes. Each node in the first group includes two CPU cores and 2G
RAM, while nodes in the second group two CPU cores and 1G RAM. The
only NUMA node defined in the third group has 8G of NVRAM, and no CPU.

Every NUMA group with CPU cores adds a package (a socket) to the
configuration, or many identical packages if "packages" > 1.  This
example creates a two-socket system, four CPU cores per package. Note
that CPU cores are divided symmetrically to packages, meaning that
every NUMA group with CPU cores should contain the same number of
cores.

CXL structures:
"cxl"                 List of host bridge connections.
"hdm-for-passthrough" (optional, next to "cxl" in the same group) true gives
                      every host bridge HDM decoders of its own
                      (pxb-cxl hdm_for_passthrough=on). Without them a host
                      bridge with a single root port passes addresses
                      through, which allows only one CXL region behind
                      the host bridge. The default is false.

                      New host bridge (pxb-cxl) is created for each list
                      of host bridge connections.
                      Each host bridge is attached to the NUMA node
                      corresponding to bridge's index in the list.
                      Each host bridge has its own CXL Fixed Memory Window
                      (cxl-fmw), that is, CXL memories are not interleaved.
                      That is, regions can be created on memory devices
                      independently.

                      Each host bridge connection is a list of root
                      port connections to the host bridge.

                      New root port (cxl-rp) is created for each list of
                      root port connections.
                      Each root port connection is a list of CXL
                      memory devices and CXL switches.

                      CXL memory devices (cxl-type3, volatile-memdev):
                        "mem"     specifies the size.
                        "present" (optional) specifies if the device is
                                  present at vm boot (true, the default)
                                  or if it can be hotplugged later (false).
                                  All devices can be hotremoved.
                        "file"    (optional) absolute path of a file that
                                  backs the memory of the device
                                  (memory-backend-file) instead of anonymous
                                  memory of the qemu process
                                  (memory-backend-ram). Qemu creates the file
                                  and sets its size if the file does not
                                  exist or is empty, but the directory of the
                                  file must exist. Qemus that are given the
                                  same file share the memory.
                        "sn"      (optional) serial number of the device, for
                                  instance "0xc1f0ee00". The default is
                                  0xc100e2e0 + index of the device. Give the
                                  same "file" and "sn" to a device in many
                                  VMs to make them see the same device.
                        "shared"  (optional) true declares that the device is
                                  meant to be shared with other VMs. Requires
                                  "file". Changes nothing in qemu options:
                                  all CXL memory is mapped with share=on.

                      The qemu memory backend of a device is always created,
                      even if the device is not present at boot. The id of
                      the backend tells how to hotplug the device:
                      be<ram|file>_cxl_memdev<N>__bus_<BUS>__sn_<SN>.

                      CXL switches (cxl-upstream, cxl-downstream):
                        "switch"  specifies a list of CXL memory devices
                                  attached to the switch.

                      Empty slots for hotplugging devices that are not
                      declared in the topology (cxl-rp or cxl-downstream
                      without a memory backend or a device):
                        "pool-slot" specifies the size of the largest device
                                  expected in the slot. It is counted in
                                  total CXL memory, like "mem" of a declared
                                  device, which sets the size of CXL memory
                                  windows.

  CXL Examples:

  # Single 8G CXL memory device attached to NUMA node 0 in a machine with 4G DRAM.
  $ python3 topology2qemuopts.py <<< '[ {"cores":2,"mem":"4G"}, {"cxl": [[{"mem":"8G"}]]} ]'

          ]}
      ]
  ]}

  # Two VMs sharing CXL memory. Give the same topology to both VMs. Both qemus
  # map the same file, so the VMs see the same memory device: same size and
  # serial number, same content. Neither VM has the device at boot. Hotplug it
  # with "vm-cxl-hotplug cxl_memdev0" in each VM. Both VMs have also two empty
  # slots (cxl-downstream ports of the switch) for hotplugging devices
  # that are not declared here, for instance by a CXL memory pool emulator.
