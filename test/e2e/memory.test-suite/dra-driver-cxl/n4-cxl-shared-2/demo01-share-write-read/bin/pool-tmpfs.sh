# pool-tmpfs.sh: the tmpfs of the pool directory of the llm-share demo,
# sourced by latency.sh and by the setup and teardown of the demo
# (e2e/.../test90-demo-setup and test91-demo-teardown). The pool server
# creates the backing files of its devices there, so the pages of this
# tmpfs are the memory of the pool devices: 2 MiB pages where possible
# (huge=within_size) with and without the latency setup. Without it the
# pages are spread evenly over the memory nodes of the host that also have
# CPUs (mpol=interleave:NODES, pool-tmpfs-spread-policy), so that the
# readers do not all wait on the one node that the first writer happened
# to run on; the latency setup binds them to the far nodes instead
# (mpol=bind:NODES).
# Mounting, unmounting and listing the users of the directory need sudo
# without a password; a memory policy needs it to pass the environment
# variable LIBMOUNT_FORCE_MOUNT2 to mount (sudoers ALL, or SETENV).
# Functions only: they return their status and never end the shell that
# sources them, also under set -e and set -o pipefail.

# The source names of the pool tmpfs in the mount table: that of the
# demo without the latency setup (latency.sh names its own).
