# CXL memory pooling with Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA)
#
# A CXL memory pool is a box of memory devices that is cabled to many
# servers. The pool attaches a device to one server when that server needs
# more memory, and detaches it when the server is done: memory moves to
# where it is needed, without opening any server.
#
# Here the pool is fake-cxl-pool-server on the host. It hotplugs CXL
# memory devices into the qemu of this VM (n4-cxl-shared-2, VM2), the
# control plane of the Kubernetes cluster of the test, where the pod runs.
# (VM1 and VM0, the VMs of n4-cxl-shared-1 and -0, are the other nodes of
# the cluster. The pool is cabled to VM1 and VM2 only.)
# Kubernetes asks for the memory with DRA:
# - fake-cxl-pool-controller (in the VM) publishes the devices of the pool
#   in a ResourceSlice of driver cxl-pool.nri.io, attaches the device that
#   the scheduler allocated for a ResourceClaim to the node the scheduler
#   picked, and writes the condition cxl-pool.nri.io/Attached to the claim.
# - kube-scheduler allocates a device for the claim and waits for that
#   binding condition before it binds the pod to the node.
# - nri-dra-driver-cxl (the CXL DRA driver, its pod on the node of the VM)
#   prepares the claim: it finds the hotplugged memory device by its
#   serial number, creates a region on it and onlines its memory. The
#   memory becomes a new NUMA node, and the container gets its id in the
#   environment variable CXL_<KEY>_NODE, next to CXL_<KEY>_MODE=numa,
#   _SIZE, _SERIAL and _SHARED, and the node in its cpuset.mems. No other
#   container of the node has the node. When the pod is gone, the node
#   plugin releases the device, the controller detaches it, and the memory
#   is back in the pool.
# The claim configures all of them with one opaque MemoryConfig: its pool
# section for the pool controller (pool.opaque.fake-cxl-pool: slot,
# numaNode, where the pool attaches the device), its device section for
# the node plugin, its container section for the NRI plugin of the driver.
# Steering is opt-in, as for local memory: without a steering policy the
# container is only fenced, the workload places its memory itself; with
# container.steering.policy auto the driver steers the memory of the
# container to the pool node.
#
# What you will see: the pool in a ResourceSlice, a claim of 512Mi that
# waits for the attachment, a new 512 MB NUMA node in the VM and in the
# pod, not steered, the memory going back to the pool; a claim that opts in
# to steering and asks the pool for a slot near NUMA node 1, its device
# under the other host bridge, a NUMA node of its own, the memory of the
# workload there; a claim with an invalid pool section that the controller
# refuses; and at the end the trace summary of what every component did, in
# order.
#
# Run test00-up of n4-cxl-shared-1, -0 and -2 first (see there for the
# patched qemu): they create the VMs and make them one cluster. The DRA
# driver comes from its image, build it first:
#   make PLUGINS=nri-dra-driver-cxl SKIP_LICENSES=1 OTHER_IMAGE_TARGETS= BINARIES= images
