"""Observations of test90-gofmbt-reliability (plan-13, 04-contract.txt 6).

Usage:
  mbt-observe.py vm [--ns NS] [--stacks-after S]
                     [--cluster --nodes ID=NODE,... --units P=UNIT,...
                     [--pools P=POOL,...]
                     [--inspected UID:RESTARTS,...]]
      In a VM, as root (mbt.source.sh installs it as /usr/local/bin/
      mbt-observe.py): print one JSON line {"vm": OBS} where OBS is the
      per-VM observation of contract 6.3: boot id, CXL memdevs, regions
      and their dax devices, the CXL ports with committed decoders
      (amendment A10), NUMA nodes, the state files of the driver,
      the device names of the CDI specs, and the cpuset.mems,
      cpuset.mems.effective and memory.high of every running container of
      namespace NS (default cxl-pool-demo).
      With --cluster (on the control plane) also "cluster": the parts of
      the settle observation (contract 6.1) that kubectl and systemd give:
      "pods" (one per mbt.slot pod, with its newest Warning event, A10),
      "companions", "others", "drivers",
      "controllers" and "inspect", the environment (and the leases of
      lease pods) of the Running and Ready slot pods whose UID:RESTARTS is
      not in --inspected (entries UID:RESTARTS[:SLOT]). ID are the VM ids
      of the model (vm2, vm1, vm0),
      NODE their Kubernetes node names; P are pool ids (a, b, c), UNIT the
      systemd units of their controllers.
      With --stacks-after S, an observation still running after S seconds
      writes to stderr the line STACKS_MARKER, the state, system call (of
      a read or write with its file) and kernel stack of the threads of
      the driver process and of itself (/proc/PID/task/TID/), and a
      second later the Python stacks of its threads.
  mbt-observe.py assemble --step N --poll K --nodes ID=NODE,...
                          --vm ID=FILE... --attachments P=FILE...
                          [--inspected-in FILE] [--inspected-out FILE]
                          [--summary FILE] [--pdev NAME=DATA:LSA...]
                          [--kill-at ID]
      On the host: merge the outputs of "vm" (FILE: what the VM printed)
      and the attachment lists of the pool servers (FILE: the JSON of
      GET /api/v1/attachments) into the settle observation of contract
      6.1, printed as one JSON line. --inspected-in has the
      UID:RESTARTS:SLOT entries inspected before (one per line),
      --inspected-out gets those of the pods that still exist plus the
      ones inspected now, but for those that list a lease on its way to
      Ready (Creating, Pending, Lending): inspected again next time.
      --summary gets lines for the shell: "driver ID POD RESTARTS READY".
      --pdev: "pdevs" of the persistent device NAME from its backing
      files DATA and LSA on the host. --kill-at: "killAt", the state of
      the driver-kill-at watcher of VM ID (A23).

Python 3 standard library only. Every part is read in its own try: a part
that cannot be read is null, and the reason is in the "errors" list of the
object that has the part.

      In a VM, as root: arm a one-shot watcher (A23 driver-kill-at) and

      dra-driver-kill) at the first poll (every MS, default 2) that sees
      the marker of a persistent Prepare that was not there when it was
      armed: region a CXL region of mode pmem; ns a namespace with a
      size in the nvdimm region of such a region; mount a mount under
      the pool plugin's mounts/; bind a mount under lease-fs/. It gives
      up after S seconds (default 60). It is bound to the driver
      process it was armed against (a pidfd): if that one ends first
      (any driver restart), it ends, not fired; it never kills another
      process. State in /run/mbt-killat/state.json: marker, armed,
      fired, done, reason (fired, expired, driver restarted, disarmed by
      VERB, or an error), ms (from arming to the kill or the end), seen
